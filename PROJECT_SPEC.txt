Project Specification
---------------------

I would expect the default output to be a friendly report in Markdown format plain-text by default, summarising the results. Here's a first draft with the scores from the Lorem Ipsum sample:

$ nameless-app lorem.txt

It should also have the option to return the same form of report in HTML and the raw data in other formats for automation - a basic line per item format, YAML, and possibly JSON.

It should probably also have a pass/fail mode where the user specifies an acceptable level and the utility just returns pass or fail according to whether the source meets that level of readability:

$ nameless-app --pass-fail-test=fog --pass-fail-level=12 my-book/
FAIL

This is probably not a good idea in most cases, but could be useful in situations where documents are required to meet a particular standard for publication.
